        I&apos;m a Franco-Irish full-stack engineer based in London with a
        background in theoretical physics. Over the past four years, I&apos;ve
        worked across the stack, building APIs, frontends, and infrastructure.

        I enjoy solving technical problems, whether itâ€™s improving database
        performance or designing modular frontend components. I also like
        working across teams to build well-structured and practical solutions.
